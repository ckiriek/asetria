## 2025-11-14 18:31 UTC - Rebrand Asetria → Skaldi
- Renamed local project folder from `asetria` to `skaldi` while preserving full Git history.
- Renamed GitHub repository from `ckiriek/asetria` to `ckiriek/skaldi` and updated documentation links.
- Renamed Vercel project to Skaldi and aligned example deployment URLs with `skaldi-ckiriek.vercel.app` and custom domain `skaldi.co`.
- Updated product-facing code and UI branding from Asetria to Skaldi (layout metadata, landing, dashboard, login, dashboard layout avatar/email).
- Updated product and deployment documentation (README, PRODUCT_OVERVIEW, PITCH_DECK, SYSTEM_OVERVIEW, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE, FINAL_STATUS, VERCEL_SETUP) to use Skaldi branding, `skaldi.co` domain, and new contact/support emails.
- Updated PubMed integration identification (tool name and contact email) and export defaults (output dir and default author) to Skaldi.
- Left historical analytical and planning documents with original Asetria naming to preserve accurate history; did not touch `package-lock.json` as it is generated and will be refreshed by npm.

What's next:
- Monitor Vercel deployments after next push from the renamed `skaldi` repo.
- Optionally, add a short note to key historical docs explaining that Asetria was the previous name of Skaldi, if needed for external readers.

## 2025-11-14 19:53 UTC - Define UX Baseline Rules (Stage 1)
- Recorded global UX baseline rules in `plan.md` for spacing, headings, card weight, and use of animations, aligned with medical-grade SaaS guidelines.
- Clarified that heavy cards (shadow, hover-lift) are reserved for key entities (projects, documents), while settings/info blocks should use flatter, lighter cards.
- Restricted large vertical paddings (`py-12`, `mt-16`) to landing/hero sections only; dashboard pages should default to more compact spacing (`space-y-4/6`).

What's next:
- Apply the new UX baseline to the dashboard layout (sidebar, top bar, main padding) as Stage 2 of the UX/UI refinement.

## 2025-11-14 20:05 UTC - Simplify Dashboard Layout & Main Page (Stage 2-3A)
- Narrowed the dashboard sidebar and main content left padding to give more horizontal space to core content.
- Made the top bar more compact (reduced height, padding, and gaps) and narrowed the search bar to avoid it dominating the header.
- Removed the unused notifications icon and badge from the header to eliminate fake alerts and visual noise.
- Simplified the main dashboard page by dropping fake percentage change metrics from stats, removing the extra separator and quick actions block, and lightening the Recent Projects list and empty state (smaller icons, tighter padding).

What's next:
- Apply similar UX compaction to the projects list page (`/dashboard/projects`) to reduce card heaviness and make empty states more compact (Stage 3B).

## 2025-11-14 20:09 UTC - Compact Projects List Page (Stage 3B)
- Lightened the projects list grid by reducing gaps, removing hover-lift and slide-in animations, and using softer hover states on cards.
- Tightened internal spacing in project cards and removed the bottom border line on the date row to make cards feel less segmented and more readable.
- Simplified the empty state for the projects page to match the dashboard pattern (smaller icon, lighter typography, standard button size).

What's next:
- Apply the same UX principles to the project creation form (`/dashboard/projects/new`) to reduce visual bulk of sections and helper blocks (Stage 3C).

## 2025-11-14 21:19 UTC - Lighten New Project Form (Stage 3C)
- Made the New Project form header and card spacing more compact (smaller heading, tighter vertical spacing between sections).
- Softened the generic RLD information block and indication helper block (lighter blue backgrounds, less padding, plain text instead of nested white card) to reduce visual weight.
- Tightened spacing in the Study Design section and actions row to align with the new UX baseline for forms.

What's next:
- Apply similar compaction and card lightening to the settings page (`/dashboard/settings`) and then normalize micro-UX patterns (empty states, spacing tokens, hover/animations) across the app (Stage 4-5).
